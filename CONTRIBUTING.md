- **Respect other contributors**: All criticism should be directed at the code, not the individual.
- **I suggest discussing changes in an issue before opening a pull request** to avoid unnecessary or invalid work.
- **Limit changes to one feature or fix per pull request**: Each pull request should focus on a single feature or bug fix. Please avoid combining multiple changes into one pull request.
- **Contributing to this project means you agree with the license** and will not add any additional copyright notices, contact information, or claims within the code.
