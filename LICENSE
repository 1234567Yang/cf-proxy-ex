其实我犹豫了很久要不要开源，因为之前的开源项目有被人拿去坑人，卖钱，但是又不想让人们重复造轮子，所以决定加入两个条件：
* 凡是使用本项目建立的代理站点，务必备注此开源链接。
* 禁止使用本项目盈利，包括基于本项目的项目。

In fact, I hesitated for a long time whether to open source, because some people used the previous open source projects to cheat people and sell them for money, but I didn't want people to reinvent the wheel, so I decided to add two conditions:
* Any proxy site established using this project must note this open source link.
* It is forbidden to use this project for profit, including projects based on this project.
